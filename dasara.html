                <strong>Plot:</strong>
            <p> In 2009, Dharani is a young ruffian, who steals coal for a living and lives with his grandmother in Veerlapally, where the womanfolk of the village are suffering as a result of influence of alcohol. He spends most of his time with his best friends Siddham "Suri" Suryam and Vennela. Dharani loves Vennela since their childhood, but later learns that Suri and Vennela love each other, where he sacrifices his love and decide to unite Suri and Vennela. However, their relationship is objected by Vennela's mother Ramanamma, due to Suri's involvement in stealing coal. Dharani speaks with her for Suri and arranges the marriage by winning a local cricket match in order to make Suri as a cashier job at the famous "Silk" bar, as announced by the village's candidate for the sarpanch Thurpugutta Shivanna's son Chinna Nambi.

                Dharani and Suri get into a fight with Chinna Nambi's supporters at the bar and damage it. As a result, Chinna Nambi gets Dharani and his friends arrested. Shivanna's kinder step-brother Rajanna bails them out and asks them to not worry about the village politics. However, Suri asks him to contest in the sarpanch elections, to which Rajanna eventually agrees. Rajanna wins the election after encouraging the womenfolk to vote for the first time and Dharani is made as the Deputy sarpanch under Rajanna. Suri's marriage with Vennela is subsequently fixed as a result. On the day of his marriage with Vennela, Suri learns about Dharani's love for Vennela and his sacrifice for him, where he gets heartbroken. As Suri is on his way to talk to Dharani and their friends at the bar, a mysterious gang attacks and chases all of them, where three of Dharani and Suri's friends are brutally killed, while another collapses from a heart attack.
                
                Dharani is injured in the ensuing chase, and Suri tries to escape with him on a bicycle. While escaping, Suri is beheaded, thus devastating Dharani and Vennela.<br><br> Baying for vengeance, Dharani begins to investigate into the matter. He learns that Chinna Nambi was the perpetrator and ordered Suri's death. Chinna Nambi's wife tells him that Chinna Nambi lusts after Vennela and had Suri killed when he learnt about his relationship with her, not because he contested against him. After learning about this, Dharani begins to protect Vennela from Chinna Nambi by marrying her during the 11th day funeral rituals of Suri. At first, Vennela sees Dharani with hatred due to him forcefully marrying her, but later grows fond of him. On the day of Dasara, Chinna Nambi reveals to Vennela about his involvement in Suri's death and Dharani's devotion to her, shocking Vennela as she was unaware of Dharani's love for her since their childhood.
                
                During the Ravana Dahanam, the same gang that chased and killed Suri and Dharani's friends are waiting to kill Dharani and his remaining friends. However, Dharani and his remaining group of friends manage to kill all of them, just as the police arrive to arrest them. Dharani reveals to the entire village of Chinna Nambi's involvement in Suri's death. Before being taken away, Dharani manages to escape from the police and decapitate Chinna Nambi in front of the entire village. Dharani and his friends are imprisoned as a result. 7 years later, Dharani and his friends arrive back to the village after finishing their sentence. Dharani learns that the husbands of the womenfolk are still suffering as a result of the influence of alcohol and finally realizes that alcohol will ruin everyone in the village. Dharani sets the bar on fire in front of the whole village, where he finally meets Vennela and they have an emotional reunion</p>
